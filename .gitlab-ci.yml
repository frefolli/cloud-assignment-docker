# The image used for this CI/CD Action should contain a JDK 17 (used by brew-day) and maven as well
# We chose a Debian Bookwork containing the AmazonCorretto redistribution of JDK 17
# Having to rely on Debian instead of Ubuntu enable us to have update yet stable toolkits.
#
# It's really important to notice how we don't need to impose dependency on NodeJS but only against Maven.
# This because our setup allow the `frontend/pom.xml` to download a distribution of node by it self.

# We define one cache that is used by all jobs
# We are allowed to define root-relative paths for targets and so on,

# As you can notice, in the root pom.xml two subprojects are defined

# - 2) backend
#
# Running `mvn compile -pl backend` will trigger the compilation of only backend, which is great

# For example, we set up a check in frontend/pom.xml to ensure that `npm run build` is run only once.

# VERIFY
#
## BACKEND
## 
## As backend linters we run
## 
## - 1) SpotBugs     https://spotbugs.github.io/
## - 2) CheckStyle   https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/
## - 3) PMD          https://pmd.github.io/
##
## Since JDK 17 is only officially supported starting with FindSec-Plugin 1.12.0,
##   and that this specific version lacks of fixes to generic type parsing introduced
##   with issue #680, we decided to run SpotBugs without it.
## 
## We also decided to run CheckStyle on the backend part using the default Sun stylechecks
##   provided by the framework for simplicity.
## 
## Finally instead of running Valgrind, which could be useful if running native application,
##   although it was suggested in the Assignment 1 paper, we run additional checks with PMD,
##   another source code analyzer, which "finds common programming flaws like unused variables,
##   empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth".
## 
## The original project ran SonarQube against both Frontend and Backend thanks to the SonarCloud
##   account provided by Ingegneria del Software course. In order to avoid abouse of this priviledge
##   and useless bloats on that account, we decided to skip the usage of this tool.
## 
## Every verification job allows mvn to fail as a trigger for upload of checking frameworks reports.
## We don't feel the need for a distinct cache space for these jobs, so we kept the main one.

## FRONTEND
## 
## As frontend linters we run
## 
## - 1) ESLint
## - 2) Flow
##
## As previous said, we skip the SonarQube analysis that was configured by us in the original trunk.
## Every verification job allows mvn to fail as a trigger for upload of checking frameworks reports.
## We don't feel the need for a distinct cache space for these jobs, so we kept the main one.
##
## In this part we call the `process-classes` lifecycle of Maven because is after compilation and before actual tests.
## This way we can have Maven to install needed dependencies and let it run after that phase the linter configured.
##
## Talking about linters, we configured ESLint and Flow as suggested by the Assignment 1 paper. We set up what i'll call
##   a weird trigger for these two frameworks: instead of enabling them with a flag, the Maven plugin we use to interact with
##   NPM allow us only to disable some executions. So we established a flag semathics where `-Dskip.{goal}` skips the goal `goal`.
##   For consistency, the rule enforced by Maven profiles that caches the previous NPM build during the stages is called `-Dskip.build`,
##   but it's activation trigger is the presence of the `frontend/build` directory in the master cache. That's why we set up a clean job
##   at the start of the Pipeline.
