## The Target Application

We decided to re-use a project we developed for Ingegneria del Software course. The project itself is a Full Stack Web App that enable the user to track it's data about recipes and beers for the sake of a home brewery. The App can be used via a Browser (tested for Firefox and Chromium) from both desktop and mobile devices, since the pages are themselves responsive.

The Backend side comprises an API Server written in Java using Spring Boot, and a Database which we can query from Java via JPA Repository framework (still part of Spring project). While the Web UI is written entirely in JS with the React frontend framework.
